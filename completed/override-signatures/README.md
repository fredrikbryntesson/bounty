## Function signatures in derived or super classes need not match
**Last updated: 2016-02-17**
*It is, for example, possible to call a super constructor which does not exist.*

## Description
It is at present possible to compile and run the following code:

```ooc
Base: class {
	value: Int
	init: func (=value)
}

Derived: class extends Base {
	init: func (v: Int) {
		super()
	}
}
```

There is no constructor in `Base` which takes zero arguments, but this code still compiles, and even runs as expected.

To solve this problem, the number (and type) of arguments should always have to match when calling super functions - both constructors and regular methods. When they do not, rock should *always* throw a compiler error.
