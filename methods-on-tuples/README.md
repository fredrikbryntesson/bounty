# An improved syntax for methods on tuples
**Last updated: 2016-02-17**
*Although tuples can be created and returned easily, one must still call methods on each element separately.*

## Description
Tuples provide an elegant way of defining in, and returning multiple variables from, a specific method. It also allows for the pythonic way of swapping the values of two variables:

```ooc
(a, b) = (b, a)
```

However, calling a method on each type requires a separate call to each element, which reduce their usefulness.

As an example, given a class `ExampleClass` with a non-returning method `method`, and three instances `a`, `b`, `c` of `ExampleClass`, the following code segments should be equal:

```ooc
a method()
b method()
c method()
```

```ooc
(a, b, c) method()
```

To solve this problem, the above statements should be equal, and should also work on methods and properties which return values, such as:

```ooc
(x, y, z) = (1, -5, 7) absoluteValue
// (x, y, z) is now (1, 5, 7)
```
